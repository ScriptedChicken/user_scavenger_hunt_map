# USERScavengerHunt
This is a scavenger hunt map centred around earthquake-related locations in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Description: 

An interactive map for use in the chch scavenger hunt activity created in 2020/2021 USER program. Based off a pre-existing MyMaps page (see USER Google Drive for documentation and other resources). This version provides a base for more functionality and style.

Needed Improvements:
* Better-stylised title page (index.html)
    
Possible Additions:
* Addition of team name input
* Originally set opacity for logo to low, user can tap/click to increase opacity
* Every location visited logged in text file, can be used for viewing later to validate points
* Add location tracking functionality
    * track location if within set bounds (central chch)
    * else, display message/icon notifying the user that they are outside of the play area
